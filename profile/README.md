## 📦 What’s Inside

The **goregion** organization hosts multiple Go projects and libraries, including:

- **must** — tiny helpers for error handling with panic, useful when explicit error handling clutters the code  
- **hexago** — boilerplate for building applications with Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)  
- **goter** — iterator utilities with context support and sequence helpers  
- **goture** — lightweight Future implementation for async tasks with result/error handling  
- **grexit** — graceful exit utility that listens to OS signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM, etc.) and shuts down applications cleanly  

*(More projects will be added as the organization grows.)*
